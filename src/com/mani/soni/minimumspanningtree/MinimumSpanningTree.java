/**
 * Minimum Spanning Tree: Finds the cheapest set of edges needed to reach all nodes in a weighted graph.
 * Given a connected and undirected graph, a spanning tree of that graph is a subgraph that is a tree and
 * connects all the vertices together. A single graph can have many different spanning trees.
 * A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree for a weighted, connected,
 * undirected graph is a spanning tree with a weight less than or equal to the weight of every other spanning tree.
