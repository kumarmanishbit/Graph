# Graph

A graph organizes items in an interconnected network. Each item is a node (or vertex). Nodes are connected by edges.

Strengths:
Representing links. Graphs are ideal for cases where you're working with things that connect to other things. 
Nodes and edges could, for example, respectively represent cities and highways, routers and ethernet cables, 
or Facebook users and their friendships. 

Weaknesses:
Scaling challenges. Most graph algorithms are O(n âˆ— lg(n)) or even slower. Depending on the size of your graph, 
running algorithms across your nodes may not be feasible.

Graph Representation:
1. Edge list
2. Adjacency list
3. Adjacency matrix

### Edge list
```java
int[][] graph = {{0, 1}, {1, 2}, {3, 1}, {2, 3}};
```

### Adjacency list
```java

Map<Integer, List<Integer>> graph = new HashMap<>() {
    {
        put(0, Arrays.asList(1));
        put(1, Arrays.asList(0, 2, 3));
        put(2, Arrays.asList(1, 3));
        put(3, Arrays.asList(1, 2));
} };

```

### Adjacency matrix:

```java
int[][] graph = {
       {0, 1, 0, 0},
       {1, 0, 1, 1},
       {0, 1, 0, 1},
       {0, 1, 1, 0},
};
```

### Topological Sort:
The topological sort algorithm takes a directed graph and returns an array of 
the nodes where each node appears before all the nodes it points to.

> The ordering of the nodes in the array is called a topological ordering.
 
Rule 1: A graph can have more than one topological ordering.
Rule 2: cyclic graphs don't have valid topological orderings.

Algorithm to develop:
> This is a common algorithm design pattern:
> 1. Figure out how to get the first thing.
> 2. Remove the first thing from the problem.
> 3. Repeat.

Back Edge:- Given a DFS tree of a graph, a Back Edge is an edge that connects a 
vertex to a vertex that is discovered before its parent. Presence of a back edge 
means presence of an alternative path in case the parent of the vertex is removed.
